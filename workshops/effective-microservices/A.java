# Effective Microservices (with or without Spring Boot)

In this workshop, attendees learn how to overcome challenges of Microservices and various distributed architectures.

Over the last decade, Microservices have become a popular architectural style for building distributed systems. However, the transition from monolithic to Microservices architecture is not straightforward. It requires a shift in mindset, culture, and practices. This workshop is designed to help you understand the principles, best practices and challenges of Microservices architecture and how to apply them effectively.

The workshop is modular and tailored to meet the specific needs of your team. We begin with a complimentary assessment to understand your goals and expectations, ensuring the content is aligned with your needs.
