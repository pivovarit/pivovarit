# Idiomatic/Advanced Golang for Java Developers

This workshop is tailored for Java engineers that want to seamlessly transition to Golang by learning idiomatic approaches instead of letting Java muscle memory kick in.  

The workshop is modular and tailored to meet the specific needs of your team. We begin with a complimentary assessment to understand your goals and expectations, ensuring the content is aligned with your needs.

Key learning points:
- Dependency Injection without Dependency Injection container (like Spring)
- Modularity, structure and organization of Golang applications
- Effective unit testing without mocks
- Demystifying consumer-side _interfaces_
- Concurrent programming with goroutines and channels
