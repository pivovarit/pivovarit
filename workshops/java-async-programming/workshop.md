# Modern Multithreading and Asynchronous Programming in Java

In this workshop, attendees learn how to write modern, resilient, safe, efficient, and idiomatic multithreaded code in Java with full understanding of the fundamentals. We focus on **establishing competencies required to navigate the complex world of multithreading and asynchronous programming** in Java.

Multithreading and asynchronicity are often shrouded in mystery, perceived as advanced topics with no definitive resource for mastering them. This is mostly because there's no central resource, no single book/course where you can obtain this knowledge.   

The workshop is modular and tailored to meet your team's specific needs. We begin with a complimentary assessment to understand your goals and expectations and ensure the content is aligned with them.

Key learning points:
- fundamentals of threading, including how to safely spawn/terminate a thread and allow the JVM to exit gracefully
- architecture and importance of thread pools, including tuning and rejection strategies
- the challenges of debugging asynchronous code and learn effective strategies for troubleshooting, monitoring, and performance tuning
- the magic of Java Memory Model
- task cancellation, `InterruptedException`, and shutdown hooks
- various types of concurrent queues
- event loops, blocking/non-blocking I/O operations
- the importance of backpressure in asynchronous systems and how to manage it effectively to prevent overwhelming resources
- `ForkJoinPool` and the parallelization of CPU-bound tasks, and learn why parallel streams may not be ideal for production environments
- the impact of context switching and how to minimize its overhead in multithreaded applications
- efficient parallel collection processing
- parallel Stream API, its downsides, and why it may not be ideal for most production environments
- idiomatic `CompletableFuture`s, their threading model, downsides, and how to circumvent them
- building asynchronous pipelines and handling complex workflows with `CompletableFuture`
- virtual threads, parallelization of blocking operations, and common issues
- understand the basics of reactive programming and when the investment may not be worthwhile
- modern Java syntax, including sneak-peek into preview features like _Structured Concurrency_ and `Gatherers.mapConcurrent`
