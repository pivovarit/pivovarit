# Pragmatic Reactive Programming in Java with Project Reactor

In this workshop, attendees learn how to write idiomatic, safe, and efficient reactive code in Java using Project Reactor. We focus on **establishing competencies required to navigate the complex world of reactive programming** in Java, emphasizing advantages and disadvantages and equipping attendees with the right tools to make informed decisions.

The workshop is modular and tailored to meet your team's specific needs. We begin with a complimentary assessment to understand your goals and expectations and ensure the content is aligned with them.
