# Modern Multithreading and Asynchronous Programming in Java

In this workshop, attendees learn how to write idiomatic, safe and efficient reactive code in Java using Project Reactor. We focus on **establishing competencies required to navigate the complex world of reactive programming** in Java, emphasizing advantages and disadvantages equipping attendees with the right tools to make informed decisions.

The workshop is modular and tailored to meet the specific needs of your team. We begin with a complimentary assessment to understand your goals and expectations, ensuring the content is aligned with your needs.
