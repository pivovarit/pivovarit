# Building Maintainable and Scalable Monoliths 

In this workshop, attendees learn how to build modular monoliths that scale in complexity, teams, and delivery speed without paying the full cost of distributed systems too early.

Over the last decade, many organizations jumped from monoliths to Microservices to solve scaling and delivery problems. In practice, Microservices often introduce new challenges: operational overhead, distributed failures, data consistency issues, and many others (covered in Challenges of Distributed Systems workshop).

A modular monolith is a powerful alternative: you keep a single deployable unit while enforcing strong internal boundaries, clear ownership, and independent evolution of modules. Done well, it delivers most of the benefits teams seek from Microservices - with far lower risk and complexity.

Key learning points:
- Modularity: Monolith vs Modular Monolith vs Microservices
- Designing module APIs: contracts, stability, and anti-corruption layers
- Enforcing boundaries in code (packaging, visibility, linting, tests, architecture rules)
- Managing shared code
- Transaction boundaries, consistency, and avoiding accidental distributed monoliths
- Intra-module communication patterns
- Refactoring strategies: strangler patterns, incrementality, and low-risk module extraction
- Hexagonal Architecture and Testing Strategies
- Preparing for future distribution
- Operational and delivery hygiene: build times, deployment pipelines, versioning
